I earned my PhD in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Glasgow and I currently work as a postdoc at UCLouvain, Belgium. I work with fmri data and neural networks. I mainly use python, R, and matlab programming languages. I favour linux machines, and working in the terminal with Vim as my editor of choice.
